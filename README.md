# Google Business Listings: A Case of Phone Number Hijacking

Hélia: Hello, everyone, and welcome to a special investigation on *In Today's France*. Today, we're delving into a story that highlights the potential pitfalls of online business listings and the need for vigilance.

Mike: That's right, Hélia. We're talking about Google's Business Listings, a free service that allows businesses to create an online presence, and how this seemingly helpful tool can be exploited.

Hélia: So, let's set the scene. Google introduced the concept of Business Listings, formerly known as Google My Business, back in 2014. These listings are like digital storefronts, allowing businesses to showcase their location, opening hours, photos, and even personalized information.

Mike: It's a great way for small businesses to gain visibility, especially in their local communities. But here's where things get interesting. When creating a listing, Google asks for basic information like the business name, address, and contact details, including a phone number.

Hélia: And this is where the issue arises. An astute Twitter user recently shared their experience when searching for a local bakery's contact information on Google. Instead of the bakery's actual number, they were presented with a premium-rate phone number starting with 089, which incurs a charge of 3 euros per call.

Mike: That's quite a surprise for someone just looking to buy a baguette! So, our curious Twitter user decided to investigate further. They discovered that this premium-rate number was not directly associated with the bakery but was, in fact, registered to a third-party company.

Hélia: This is where it gets even more concerning. Upon further research, it was found that this same premium-rate number was linked to the Google Business Listings of other bakeries, not just in the same town but also in Paris.

Mike: A clear case of phone number hijacking, Hélia. It seems someone has been taking advantage of Google's listing service to generate revenue through these premium-rate calls.

Hélia: Absolutely. And this raises important questions about the verification process for these listings. Google does mention that they may request additional information for validation, but there doesn't seem to be a systematic check on the provided contact details.

Mike: It's a loophole that needs addressing. The ease of creating these listings, combined with the potential for financial gain, has led to this unfortunate situation.

Hélia: Now, let's talk about the different types of phone numbers and how they work in France. Premium-rate numbers, like the one in this case, are part of a specific category. They start with 081, 082, or 089, and calls to these numbers incur additional charges.

Mike: It's essential for consumers to be aware of these prefixes. There are also toll-free numbers starting with 0800 to 0805, and shared-cost numbers from 0806 to 0809, which are free but may be deducted from your phone plan allowance.

Hélia: This incident also brings to light the importance of businesses managing their online presence. Google allows businesses to claim ownership of their listings, even if they were initially created by someone else.

Mike: That's a crucial feature, Hélia. According to Google's FAQ, if a business owner doesn't respond to a claim request within three days, the claimant may be able to take control of the listing.

Hélia: So, a business owner who is not regularly checking their associated email address could potentially lose control of their online presence.

Mike: Exactly. This story serves as a reminder for businesses to stay vigilant and actively manage their online profiles.

Hélia: Absolutely. As we wrap up, let's emphasize the need for both consumers and businesses to be aware of these potential pitfalls. Stay informed, and don't hesitate to question suspicious online information.

Mike: Well said, Hélia. Until next time, keep those eyes and ears open, and stay tuned to *In Today's France* for more insightful investigations.
